# Changelogs

## Version 3.4.1 highlights

- Discovery and time sync routing integration:
    - Added built-in `DISCOVERY_TIMESYNC_SOURCES` advertisements so routers and relays can learn
      concrete reachable time source sender IDs instead of only generic `TIME_SYNC` endpoint
      reachability.
    - `TIME_SYNC` requests now prefer exact discovered source paths when the current selected
      source is known through discovery.
    - `export_topology()` now includes advertised and reachable time source IDs alongside endpoint
      reachability.
- Time sync failover and traffic reduction:
    - `TimeSyncTracker` now keeps the active source set and can fail over immediately to a
      same-priority or lower-priority standby source that is still active.
    - Source-generated `TIME_SYNC_RESPONSE` traffic now returns to the requesting ingress side
      instead of being broadcast to every side.
    - Fixed an internal request-serving deadlock by avoiding timesync mutex re-entry while
      sampling source-side timestamps.

## Version 3.4.0 highlights

- Router-managed time sync and network clock:
    - Time sync is now handled internally by the router instead of through normal local `TIME_SYNC`
      endpoint handlers.
    - Routers maintain an internal non-monotonic network clock separate from their monotonic timing
      source.
    - Packet timestamps now prefer the internal network clock when one is available.
- Partial time-source merging and master clock injection:
    - The internal network clock can merge partial sources, such as date from one source and
      time-of-day or subsecond precision from another.
    - Added master/local time setter APIs for complete or partial network time, including
      date-only, hour/minute, hour/minute/second, millisecond, and nanosecond variants.
    - Local time setters are anchored at commit time so short context switches during updates do
      not leave complete absolute times stale.
- Constructor and FFI clock model updates:
    - On `std` builds, `Router::new(...)` now uses an internal monotonic clock by default.
    - Added `Router::new_with_clock(...)` for tests, simulation, and `no_std` / embedded clock
      injection.
    - C and Python router constructors now treat the monotonic clock callback as optional on
      `std` builds and fall back to the internal router clock when it is omitted.
- C system-test and harness improvements:
    - Fixed a relay timing issue in the C system-test path that could cause shutdown to stall.
    - Updated C time-sync tests to follow the internal router-managed time-sync model.
    - Added bounded timeout handling in the Rust C-test harness so future regressions fail fast
      instead of hanging indefinitely.
- Documentation refresh:
    - Updated Rust, C, and Python usage docs to reflect the new router constructor model.
    - Expanded time-sync documentation to cover the internal network clock, merged partial
      sources, current network time accessors, and master-side setter APIs.

  changelog: [v3.3.0...v3.4.0](https://github.com/Rylan-Meilutis/sedsprintf_rs/compare/v3.3.0...v3.4.0)

## Version 3.3.0 highlights

- Discovery/routing control plane:
    - Added built-in discovery advertisements for routers and relays under the `discovery` feature.
    - Routers and relays now learn endpoint reachability, export topology snapshots, and use adaptive announce
      intervals that speed up after topology changes and back off when stable.
    - Selective forwarding now uses discovered reachability first and falls back to ordinary flooding when routes are
      unknown.
- Reliability and forwarding integration:
    - Reliable packets are now fanned out to all discovered candidate sides instead of relying only on blind flooding.
    - Added additional routing tests to ensure discovery does not cause link-local traffic to leak onto normal network
      sides.
- Link-local/software-bus IPC support:
    - Added link-local-only endpoint support for software-bus / IPC traffic.
    - Discovery advertisements are filtered per-side so IPC endpoints are not exposed on non-link-local links.
    - Routers and relays now enforce link-local routing boundaries even when discovery data is overly broad.
- Split schema support for per-board IPC:
    - Added `SEDSPRINTF_RS_IPC_SCHEMA_PATH` for board-local IPC overlays that merge with the shared base schema.
    - IPC overlay endpoints are treated as link-local automatically; base-schema endpoints are treated as non-link-local
      automatically.
    - Added proc-macro/build-script tests for overlay merging, collision rejection, and link-local normalization.
- Telemetry config editor updates:
    - The GUI editor can now open, edit, and save the base schema and IPC overlay as separate files.
    - IPC overlay paths can live outside the repository and be supplied by environment-driven build systems such as
      CMake or `.cargo/config.toml`.
    - Link-local scope is now derived from which file is being edited rather than being a user-editable checkbox.

## Version 3.2.3 highlights

- Compression backend consolidation:
    - Switched to a single backend (`zstd-safe`) for sender/payload compression.
    - Removed compression-level configuration knobs from build/docs/examples.
    - Kept bounded compression behavior and added constrained-memory regression tests.
- Router/FFI queueing and re-entrancy hardening:
    - RX queue paths and lock behavior were tightened to avoid deadlocks under RTOS-like concurrency.
    - Added tests for handler re-entry into router APIs and mixed ingress/processing concurrency.
- Time sync validation expansion:
    - Added C system tests for multi-node time sync and board-topology scenarios (grandmaster + consumers).
    - Added failover coverage where backup sources are selected after source timeout.
- C/C++ integration updates:
    - Expanded C header template function descriptions.
    - macOS C system-test builds now align deployment target settings with Rust staticlib builds to avoid linker
      mismatch warnings.

  changelog: [v3.0.0...v3.1.0](https://github.com/Rylan-Meilutis/sedsprintf_rs/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0)

## Version 3.0.0 highlights

- Router side tracking is internal. Most applications should call the plain RX APIs (`rx_serialized` / `rx`) and only
  use side-aware variants when explicitly overriding ingress (custom relays, multi-link bridges, etc.).
- TCP-like reliability is now available for schema types marked `reliable` / `reliable_mode`, with ACKs, retransmits,
  and optional ordering. Enable per side and disable when the transport is already reliable.
