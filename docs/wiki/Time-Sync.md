# Time Sync

This page explains the built-in time sync support that ships with the `timesync` feature.

## Enabling time sync

- Enable the `timesync` Cargo feature.
- Python builds in this repo enable it by default (
  pyproject.toml ([source](https://github.com/Rylan-Meilutis/sedsprintf_rs/blob/main/pyproject.toml))).

When enabled, the build adds the `TIME_SYNC` endpoint (broadcast mode `Always`) plus built-in
time sync packet types in code.

The current model is router-owned:

- The router keeps an internal non-monotonic network clock separate from the monotonic clock you
  use for router timing (`Router::new(...)` on `std`, or `Router::new_with_clock(...)` when you
  provide a custom clock).
- The monotonic clock drives scheduling, request timestamps, holdover, and slew; it is not treated
  as UTC.
- `TIME_SYNC` traffic is consumed internally by the router. It does not dispatch to normal local
  endpoint handlers.
- Packet timestamps prefer the internal network clock when one is available.
- The internal clock can merge partial sources, for example date from one source and time-of-day
  or subsecond precision from another.

If a router transmits a time sync packet and the same frame loops back into that router, it is
normally ignored by RX dedupe before internal time sync processing runs.

## Packet types and fields

All payload fields are `u64` values in little-endian order. Timestamps are in milliseconds.

- `TimeSyncAnnounce`: `[priority, time_ms]`
- `TimeSyncRequest`: `[seq, t1_ms]`
- `TimeSyncResponse`: `[seq, t1_ms, t2_ms, t3_ms]`

With the `discovery` feature enabled, discovery also adds a built-in
`DISCOVERY_TIMESYNC_SOURCES` control packet that advertises concrete time source sender IDs.

`t4_ms` is captured locally when the response is received; it is not part of the packet payload.

## Internal router behavior

The router handles the built-in time sync packet types internally:

- `TimeSyncAnnounce` updates per-remote-source state; the router does not collapse all remotes into
  one shared slot.
- `TimeSyncRequest` may cause the router to queue an internal response when it is acting as a
  source.
- `TimeSyncResponse` updates the leader's remote sample and steers the local network clock using
  the local monotonic receive time.
- When discovery is enabled, outbound `TIME_SYNC` traffic prefers exact discovered source paths
  over generic `TIME_SYNC` endpoint reachability.
- Internally generated `TimeSyncResponse` packets are returned to the requesting ingress side
  instead of being broadcast to every side.

Applications can read the resulting network time through:

- Rust: `router.network_time()` / `router.network_time_ms()`
- C: `seds_router_get_network_time()` / `seds_router_get_network_time_ms()`
- Python: `router.network_time()` / `router.network_time_ms()`

## Roles and source selection

`TimeSyncTracker` maintains the current best source and exposes a small state machine:

- `Consumer`: follows the elected producer. If `consumer_promotion_enabled` is set and there are no
  active producers, a consumer that already has non-uptime-based network time may temporarily
  promote itself to keep the network aligned.
- `Source`: participates in election as a producer. It announces and serves only while it is the
  elected leader; otherwise it follows the leader like a consumer.
- `Auto`: acts like an opportunistic producer. It only enters the election when no active producer
  is present and it has usable network time.

Sources are chosen by priority (lower is better). Ties are broken by sender ID (lexicographic).
When several producers have the same configured priority, the elected leader advertises a boosted
priority for as long as it remains leader so the tie resolves consistently without changing the
standby producers' configured priorities. If no announce is seen within `source_timeout_ms`, a
source is considered inactive.

Failover uses holdover plus slew:

- the network clock keeps running monotonically during producer loss or producer change
- a new leader does not step the clock backward or forward immediately
- instead, the router slews toward the new leader at the configured `max_slew_ppm` rate

The internal clock also supports merging partial absolute sources:

- complete date from one source
- time-of-day from another source
- subsecond precision from another source

When a complete date+time base exists, the router advances it forward using the monotonic clock.

## Discovery integration

With both `timesync` and `discovery` enabled:

- discovery advertisements include `TIME_SYNC` endpoint reachability
- routers and relays also advertise reachable time source sender IDs
- `export_topology()` includes both reachable endpoints and reachable time source IDs per side
- a consumer can route requests toward the exact side that leads to its selected source instead of
  sending requests to every side that merely exposes `TIME_SYNC`

If no exact source route is known yet, routing still falls back to ordinary endpoint-based
discovery or flooding.

## Typical flow

1) A source periodically sends `TimeSyncAnnounce`.
2) The elected follower sends `TimeSyncRequest` with monotonic `t1_ms`.
3) The elected source replies with `TimeSyncResponse` and timestamps `t2_ms`/`t3_ms` in network
   time.
4) The consumer captures `t4_ms` and calls `compute_offset_delay(t1, t2, t3, t4)`.

The returned `offset_ms` and `delay_ms` mirror the standard NTP-style round trip calculation.

For most applications using router-managed timesync, you do not need to manually send or decode
these packets. The router can announce, request, respond, and maintain the internal network clock
itself once time sync is configured.

Drive that runtime with `periodic(timeout_ms)` in normal application loops. That runs time sync,
discovery, and queue draining together. If you need to skip time sync for a cycle while keeping the
feature enabled, use `periodic_no_timesync(timeout_ms)`.
`poll_timesync()` remains available as a lower-level hook when you want to queue only due
announce/request traffic and manage the surrounding queue processing yourself.

If you want a producer to advertise real UTC, inject that absolute time through the local network
time setters. The router's timing callback remains monotonic-only.

## Master / local clock injection

In addition to packet-driven sync, a source/master can set its local network time directly.

Rust router APIs:

- `set_local_network_time(PartialNetworkTime)`
- `set_local_network_date(...)`
- `set_local_network_time_hm(...)`
- `set_local_network_time_hms(...)`
- `set_local_network_time_hms_millis(...)`
- `set_local_network_time_hms_nanos(...)`
- `set_local_network_datetime(...)`
- `set_local_network_datetime_millis(...)`
- `set_local_network_datetime_nanos(...)`

C APIs:

- `seds_router_set_local_network_time(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_date(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_time_hm(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_time_hms(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_time_hms_millis(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_time_hms_nanos(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_datetime(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_datetime_millis(...)`
- `seds_router_set_local_network_datetime_nanos(...)`

Python APIs:

- `router.set_local_network_time(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_date(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_time_hm(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_time_hms(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_time_hms_millis(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_time_hms_nanos(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_datetime(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_datetime_millis(...)`
- `router.set_local_network_datetime_nanos(...)`

These setters are safe to call from multiple threads because the internal clock update is
serialized by the router. For complete date+time values, the implementation re-samples the
monotonic clock at commit so short context switches during the call do not leave the stored time
stale.

## API entry points

Rust helpers live in `sedsprintf_rs::timesync`:

- `TimeSyncConfig`, `TimeSyncRole`, `TimeSyncTracker`
- `send_timesync_announce`, `send_timesync_request`, `send_timesync_response`
- `build_timesync_*`, `decode_timesync_*`, `compute_offset_delay`

Router-managed APIs live on `Router` and the C/Python FFI surfaces described above.
